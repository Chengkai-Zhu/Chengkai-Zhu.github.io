The inherent irreversibility of quantum dynamics for open systems poses a significant barrier to the inversion of unknown quantum processes. To tackle this challenge, we propose the framework of virtual combs that exploit the unknown process iteratively with additional classical post-processing to simulate the process inverse. Notably, we demonstrate that an n-slot virtual comb can exactly reverse a depolarizing channel with one unknown noise parameter out of n+1 potential candidates, and a 1-slot virtual comb can exactly reverse an arbitrary pair of quantum channels. We further explore the approximate inversion of an unknown channel within a given channel set. A worst-case error decay of $O(n^{âˆ’1})$ is unveiled for depolarizing channels within a specified noise region. Moreover, we show that virtual combs can universally reverse unitary operations and investigate the trade-off between the slot number and the sampling overhead.
