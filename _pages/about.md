I am a second year PhD student from [Information Hub](https://infh.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/). My research interest includes quantum information theory and quantum algorithms.

I am supervised by [Prof. Xin Wang](https://www.xinwang.info/) from the HKUST(GZ). I was previously supervised by [Prof. Zhenyu Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=omCIQ64AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/).
